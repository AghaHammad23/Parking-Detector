### **Comprehensive Overview of the Parking Spot Detection Project (Including Classification Technique)**

---

#### **Objective:**
The project automates the detection of **occupied** and **empty** parking spots in a video of a parking area. It uses video processing, image classification with machine learning, and visualization to highlight the parking spot statuses. The project prepares a robust pipeline that can extend to real-time applications, such as live parking lot monitoring.

### **Step-by-Step Workflow**

---

### **Phase 1: Input and Mask Processing**

1. **Inputs:**
   - **Mask Image (`mask_1920_1080.png`):**
     - A binary image with white regions marking parking spots.
     - It simplifies the process by eliminating unnecessary parts of the parking lot.
   - **Parking Video (`parking_1920_1080.mp4`):**
     - A video showing the parking lot.

2. **Processing the Mask:**
   - **Load Mask in Grayscale:**
     - The mask is read using `cv2.imread()` in grayscale mode.
   - **Connected Components:**
     - `cv2.connectedComponentsWithStats()` is used to extract connected white regions, treating each as a **parking spot**.
     - For each connected component, the bounding box coordinates (`x, y, width, height`) and area are calculated.
   - **Result:**
     - The mask provides bounding boxes, defining **Regions of Interest (ROIs)** for parking spots.

---

### **Phase 2: Extracting Parking Spots (Cropping and Saving Images)**

1. **Bounding Boxes on the Video:**
   - Using the bounding boxes from the mask, the parking video is processed frame-by-frame using `cv2.VideoCapture()`.
   - For every frame:
     - Each bounding box is applied to crop out individual parking spots (ROIs).
     - Cropped images are saved as separate files for further processing.

2. **Directory Organization for Cropped Images:**
   - Two folders (`empty` and `not_empty`) are manually or semi-automatically populated with cropped images:
     - **`empty/` Folder:**
       - Contains images of parking spots without vehicles.
     - **`not_empty/` Folder:**
       - Contains images of parking spots with vehicles.
   - **Manual or Automated Sorting:**
     - Sorting can be manual (by visual inspection) or automated (e.g., using pixel intensity differences to detect changes).

### **Phase 3: Machine Learning Classification**

1. **Goal:**
   - Train a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier to automatically identify whether a parking spot is "empty" or "not_empty."

2. **Steps in Classification:**

   - **Data Preparation:**
     - Load cropped images from the `empty/` and `not_empty/` folders.
     - Resize each image to **15x15 pixels** to reduce computational complexity.
     - Flatten each resized image into a 1D array for input into the SVM model.
     - Assign labels:
       - `0` for "empty."
       - `1` for "not_empty."

   - **Splitting Dataset:**
     - Use `train_test_split()` to divide the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
     - Ensure stratified sampling to maintain a balanced distribution of "empty" and "not_empty" samples.

   - **Training the SVM Model:**
     - The SVM is trained using **GridSearchCV** to find the best combination of hyperparameters:
       - `C` (regularization parameter).
       - `gamma` (kernel coefficient).
     - The best model is saved as `model.p` using the `pickle` library.

   - **Testing the Model:**
     - Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy on the test set using `accuracy_score()`.

3. **Output:**
   - A trained classifier (`model.p`) capable of predicting whether a parking spot is empty or not.

---

### **Phase 4: Video Analysis and Visualization**

1. **Video Processing:**
   - Load the trained model (`model.p`).
   - Use the bounding boxes from the mask to crop parking spots in each frame of the video.
   - Resize the cropped spot to 15x15 pixels and use the SVM model to classify it as "empty" or "not_empty."

2. **Visualization:**
   - For each frame:
     - Draw **green bounding boxes** around "empty" parking spots.
     - Draw **red bounding boxes** around "not_empty" parking spots.
   - Display the total number of available spots on the frame.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - Process every **30th frame** (`step = 30`) to reduce computation time.

4. **Output:**
   - Real-time visualization of parking spot statuses in the video.

---

### **Phase 5: Extending to Live Video**

1. **Replacing Video File with Live Feed:**
   - Use `cv2.VideoCapture(0)` for webcam or provide an IP camera stream URL.
   - The rest of the pipeline (cropping, resizing, classification) remains the same.

2. **Challenges and Optimizations for Live Video:**
   - **Frame Skipping:**
     - Process every nth frame to ensure real-time performance.
   - **Lighting Changes:**
     - Add preprocessing techniques (e.g., histogram equalization) to handle varying light conditions.
   - **Dynamic Parking Spots:**
     - Use a deep learning model like YOLO or Faster R-CNN for real-time detection of parking spots without relying on a static mask.
